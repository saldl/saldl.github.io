:title: saldl: A lightweight well-featured CLI downloader optimized for speed and early preview

*saldl* is a lightweight well-featured CLI downloader optimized for speed
and early preview.

By default, *saldl* splits a download into fixed-sized chunks and download them
in-order with multiple concurrent connections. Other modes are also available
as 'options'.
 +
 +

All 'options' are documented in the <<man,manual page>>.
 +
 +

*saldl* is open-source and multi-platform. It has been tested on
GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.
 +
 +


Windows binaries are provided with
https://github.com/saldl/saldl/releases[every release].
Mac OSX users can use *Homebrew* to install *saldl*.

Detailed build/install instructions are available in the
https://github.com/saldl/saldl/blob/master/README.md[README].
