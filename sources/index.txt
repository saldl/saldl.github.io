= saldl: A command-line downloader with unique features based on libcurl
:toc:

== Preface

By default, saldl splits a download into fixed-sized chunks and download
them in-order with multiple concurrent connections.

Many options are availabe. They are documented in
the <<man,manual page>>.

== Screenshot

   -s4m => set chunk_size to 4 MiB.
   -c4  => use 4 concurrent connections.
   -l4  => download the last 4 chunks first.
