= saldl: A lightweight CLI downloader optimized for speed and early preview

*saldl* splits a download into fixed-sized chunks and download them
in-order with multiple concurrent connections. Classic modes
(single chunk single connection, no. of chunks = no. of connections)
are also available as 'options'.

All 'options' are documented in the <<man,manual page>>.

*saldl* is open-source and multi-platform. It is available for everyone
under the terms of the https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.txt[AGPL].
